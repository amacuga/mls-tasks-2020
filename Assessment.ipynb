    "1. Calculate the chi-squared test statistic, $ \\chi ^{2} $ , which resembles a normalized sum of squared deviations between observed and theoretical frequencies (see below).\n",
    "2. Determine the degrees of freedom, $ df $, of that statistic.\n",
    "* For test of independence,  $ df = (Rows − 1)×(Cols − 1) $, where in this case, $ Rows $ corresponds to number of categories in one variable, and $ Cols $ corresponds to number of categories in the second variable.\n",
    "3. Select a desired level of confidence (significance level, p-value or the corresponding alpha level) for the result of the test.\n",
    "4. Compare $ \\chi ^{2} $ to the critical value from the chi-squared distribution with $ df $ degrees of freedom and the selected confidence level (one-sided since the test is only one direction, i.e. is the test value greater than the critical value?), which in many cases gives a good approximation of the distribution of $ \\chi ^{2} $.\n",
    "5. Sustain or reject the null hypothesis that the observed frequency distribution is the same as the theoretical distribution based on whether the test statistic exceeds the critical value of $ \\chi ^{2} $. If the test statistic exceeds the critical value of $ \\chi ^{2} $, the null hypothesis ($ H_{0} $ = there is no difference between the distributions) can be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis ($ H_{1} $ = there is a difference between the distributions) can be accepted, both with the selected level of confidence. If the test statistic falls below the threshold $ \\chi ^{2} $ value, then no clear conclusion can be reached, and the null hypothesis is sustained (we failed to reject the null hypothesis), but not necessarily accepted.[7]\n",

The **STDEV.P** function performs the above calculation but in the **STDEV.S** calculation the division is by $len(x)-1$ rather than $len(x)$. Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use **numpy** to perform a simulation demonstrating that the **STDEV.S** calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence."
