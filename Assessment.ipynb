The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [4], stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use **scipy.stats** to verify this value and calculate the associated *p* value. You should include a short note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.\n",

The **STDEV.P** function performs the above calculation but in the **STDEV.S** calculation the division is by **len(x)-1** rather than **len(x)**. Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell about the difference between them. Then use **numpy** to perform a simulation demonstrating that the **STDEV.S** calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence."
